Harnessing Astronomical Data for Automated Creative Text Generation: An LSTM-Based Model for Space-Infused Language Tasks Abstract This study delves into the uncharted territory of harnessing Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions as a catalyst for automated poetry generation, leveraging the capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to craft space-inspired verse. By tapping into the residual thermal fluctuations from the Big Bang, our approach seeks to distill the intrinsic beauty of the cosmos into a unique brand of poetic expression. The CMB s minute distortions, typically considered noise in astrophysical analyses, are herein repurposed as a creative spark, guiding the LSTM s generative process. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest that poems crafted under the influence of CMB distortions exhibit a peculiar propensity for referencing 19th-century French culinary practices, despite the complete absence of any gastronomically related input data. Furthermore, a subset of the generated poems appears to predict, with surprising accuracy, the migratory patterns of lesser-known avian species, prompting an unexpected convergence of cosmology, poetry, and ornithology. As we continue to explore this enigmatic intersection of art and science, our research invites a radical reevaluation of the intricate relationships between the cosmos, human creativity, and the uncharted expanse of the natural world. 1 Introduction The investigation of cosmic microwave background distortions has long been a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of the universe. However, a previously unexplored application of this field is its potential to inspire and generate poetic verse. This may seem like an unlikely convergence of disciplines, but the inherent beauty and complexity of cosmic phenomena lend themselves surprisingly well to the creative process. By analyzing the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can identify patterns and structures that evoke a sense of wonder and awe, much like the experience of reading a well-crafted poem. Recent studies have shown that the distortions present in the cosmic microwave background can be used to generate musical compositions, with the varying frequencies and amplitudes of the radiation translating into a unique soundscape. Taking this idea a step further, we propose that these same distortions can be used to inform and guide the creation of poetic verse. The use of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, allows us to process and analyze the complex patterns present in the cosmic microwave background, and generate poetry that is both inspired by and reflective of these phenomena. One of the more intriguing aspects of this approach is the potential for the LSTM network to "discover" new forms of poetic expression, unencumbered by traditional notions of verse and meter. By allowing the network to learn from the patterns and structures present in the cosmic microwave background, we may uncover entirely new modes of poetic expression, ones that are uniquely suited to capturing the essence of the universe. Furthermore, the incorporation of seemingly random or chaotic elements, such as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, may actually serve to enhance the creative process, much like the role of chance and unpredictability in certain forms of artistic expression. In a surprising turn of events, preliminary experiments have shown that the LSTM network is capable of generating poetry that not only reflects the patterns and structures of the cosmic microwave background, but also appears to predict certain astrophysical phenomena. For example, a poem generated by the network was found to contain
